# sinatra-docker-kick-start
A dockerized "hello world" sinatra app. It is a child of the amazing guide at https://rubyplus.com/articles/2461-Docker-Basics-Running-a-Hello-World-Sinatra-App-in-a-Container.

Build with Ruby v-2.3.3. Use docker-compose; the best way to kick-start it is running docker-componse in a container, for that use the following script:
```
$ sudo curl -L --fail https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.0/run.sh -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

```
